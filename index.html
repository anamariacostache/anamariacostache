<h1>Anamaria Costache </h1>
<p>Hi there! I am currently a PhD student at Bristol University, under the supervision of Nigel Smart. My topic of research is Fully Homomorphic Encryption. </p>

<p>Here are my publications:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/889.pdf">Which Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption Scheme is Best?</a> (CT-RSA 2016), Anamaria Costache, Nigel P. Smart</li>    
    <li><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/250.pdf">Fixed Point Arithmetic in SHE Schemes</a> (SAC 2016) Anamaria Costache, Nigel P. Smart, Srinivas Vivek and Adrian Waller</li>
    <li><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1019.pdf">Faster Homomorphic Evaluation of Discrete Fourier Transforms</a> (FC 2017) Anamaria Costache and Nigel P. Smart and Srinivas Vivek</li>
  </ul>

<p>Here are some of my talks: </p>
<ul>
<li>Which Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption Scheme is Best? - at CT-RSA 2016 in San Francisco, USA </li>
<li>On Ring Learning with Errors and its uses in cryptography - at the Oxford Cryptography seminar </li>
<li>Fixed Point Arithmetic in SHE Schemes - at the London Lattice Day in London, UK </li>
